    "Probability theory is primarily concerned with calculating various quantities associated with a probability model. This requires that we know what the correct probability model is. In applications, this is often not the case, and the best we can say is that the correct probability measure to use is in a set of possible probability measures. We refer to this collection as the statistical model. So, in a sense, our uncertainty has increased; not only do we have the uncertainty associated with an outcome or response as described by a probability measure, but now we are also uncertain about what the probability measure is.\n",
    "Statistical inference is concerned with making statements or inferences about characteristics of the true underlying probability measure. Of course, these inferences must be based on some kind of information; the statistical model makes up part of it. Another important part of the information will be given by an observed outcome or response, which we refer to as the data. Inferences then take the form of various statements about the true underlying probability measure from which the data were obtained. These take a variety of forms, which we refer to as types of inferences.\n",

    "- Statistics is applied to situations in which we have questions that cannot be answered definitively, typically because of variation in data.\n",
    "- Probability is used to model the variation observed in the data. Statistical inference is concerned with using the observed data to help identify the true probability distribution (or distributions) producing this variation and thus gain insight into the answers to the questions of interest.\n",

    "In general when you have a population to study, we are often presented with data that are supposed to be produced by a random mechanism. In other words, suppose we are in a situation involving a measurement $X$, whose distribution is unknown, and we have obtained the data (realizations of the random variable $X$) $(x_1, x2,\\ldots , x_n)$ , i.e., observed $n$ values of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do now with the data depends on two things : First, we have to determine what we want to know about the underlying population distribution. Second, we have to use statistical theory to combine the data with the statistical model to make inferences about the characteristics of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, for a big population, it is not possible (or it is very time consuming) to collect information about all population individuals. Therefore, the true statistical model of the whole population is very often unknown. Hence, a part of the population called a sample of the population is studied and the statistical inference on the whole population is performed based on the statistical analysis of the sample.  "

    "## 2) Types of Inference\n",
    "Certainly quoting descriptive statistics and plotting the data are methods used by a statistician to try to learn something about the underlying population distribution. There are difficulties with this approach, however, as we have just chosen these methods based on intuition. Often it is not clear which descriptive statistics we should use. Furthermore, these data summaries make no use of the information we have about the true population distribution as expressed by the statistical model, namely, $f_X$ which depends on a (or more than one) parameter $\\theta$. Taking account of this information leads us to develop a theory of statistical inference, i.e., to specify how we should combine the model information together with the data to make inferences about population quantities. We will do this by Likelihood (or classical) Inference and Bayesian Inference. In a statistical application, we do not know $f$ as a function of the unknown parameter $\\theta$ (Parametric distributions); we know only that $f\\in \\{f_{\\theta} : \\theta \\in \\Theta\\}$ ($\\Theta$ is the set of all possible values of $\\theta$), and we observe the data $x$. We are uncertain about which candidate $f_{\\theta}$ is correct, or, equivalently, which of the possible values of $\\theta$ is correct. Hence, if $\\phi(\\theta)$ is a fonction of the unknown parameter $\\theta$, three types of inference are considered for $\\phi(\\theta)$ :\n",

    "### Likelihood Inference\n",
    "Likelihood inferences are based only on the data $x$ and the model $\\{P_{\\theta} : \\theta \\in\\theta\\}$, the set of possible probability measures for the system under investigation. From these ingredients we obtain the basic entity of likelihood inference, namely, the likelihood function.\n",

    " and is referred to as the null hypothesis. The word null is used because the value specified in $H_0$ is often associated with a treatment having no effect. For example, if we want to assess whether or not a proposed new drug does a better job of treating a particular condition than a standard treatment does, the null hypothesis will often be equivalent to the new drug providing no improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistician is then charged with assessing whether or not the observed $x$ is in accord with this hypothesis. So we wish to assess the evidence in $x$ for $\\phi(\\theta) = \\phi_0$ being true. A statistical procedure that does this can be referred to as a hypothesis assessment, a test of significance, or a test of hypothesis. Such a procedure involves measuring how surprising the observed $x$ is when we assume $H_0$ to be true. It is clear that $x$ is surprising whenever $x$ lies in a region of low probability for each of the distributions specified by the null hypothesis. If we decide that the data are surprising under $H_0$, then this is evidence against $H_0$. This assessment is carried out by calculating a probability, called a P-value, so that small values of the P-value indicate that $x$ is surprising.\n",

    "##### How to perform a hypothesis test\n",
    "In practice, we always consider another hypothesis against $H_0$, called alternative hypothesis $H_1$, and we say that the null hypothesis can not be accepted if the evidence in $x$ for  the alternative hypothesis being true is stronger than for $H_0$. In other words, for our Normal distribution if $$\n",

    "where $c$ is a constant. The inequality above gives us what we call the rejection region of $H_0$, $R_{H_0}$ as a function of $T(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)$ and $T$ is called the test statistics. In practice, $R_{H_0}$ is an inequality of the form $T(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)>k$ or $T(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)<k$ where $k$ is a function of $c$. Then, we calculate P-value, the probability of $R_{H_0}$ under the null hypothesis (assuming the null hypothesis is true) based on the observations $T(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$.\n",

    "### Bayesian Inference\n",
    "At the heart of the theory of inference is the concept of the statistical model $\\{P_{\\theta} : \\theta\\in \\Theta\\}$ that describes the statistician’s uncertainty about how the observed data were produced. Previous section dealt with the analysis of this uncertainty based on the model and the data alone. In some cases, this seemed quite successful, but we note that we only dealt with some of the simpler contexts there.\n",
    "If we accept the principle that, to be amenable to analysis, all uncertainties need to be described by probabilities, then the prescription of a model alone is incomplete, as this does not tell us how to make probability statements about the unknown true value of $\\theta$. In this section, we complete the description so that all uncertainties are described by probabilities. This leads to a probability distribution for $\\theta$, and the parameter now plays the role of the unobserved response or a new random variable. This is the Bayesian approach to inference.\n",

After observing the data, the relevant distribution to use in making probability statements about $\\theta$ is the conditional distribution of $\\theta$ given $x$.
